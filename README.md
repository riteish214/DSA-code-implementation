# DSA code implementation
Data Structures and Algorithms in Python This repository contains Python implementations of essential Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It is designed to help beginners and intermediate learners understand and practice key computer science concepts, and provides efficient, easy-to-understand solutions for a variety of common coding problems.  The repository covers a wide range of data structures, including:  Arrays  Linked Lists  Stacks  Queues  Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees)  Graphs  Hash Tables  Heaps  Along with these, you’ll also find common algorithms that are crucial for problem-solving:  Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Merge, Quick, etc.)  Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search)  Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s Algorithm)  Dynamic Programming  Greedy Algorithms  Backtracking Algorithms  Divide and Conquer
